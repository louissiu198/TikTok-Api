### Why Is RapidAPI required for this script?
- [TTEncrypt] - for device_registeration to generate your own devices [Soon documentations would be published] - endpoint is on API
- [Mssdk Enc/Dec] - for activating device_id, install_id, device_token by MSSDK for registration/login/follow [Soon documentations would be published] - endpoint is on API
- [TTSignature] - for every request in TikTok, it requires signatures (xa,xl,xh,xk) in headers to confirm you are not automating it, mainly checking on lc_id, params, stub hash, support MSSDK "v05.02.00-android" onwards [views/likes/shares all requires this]

- I don't directly provide all the accounts, I can only supply [Bot account], For the others I have methods to resell from private sources
- If you can find Tiktok Maliva Accounts and convert them into my format, I welcome you to skip this option [You better prepare your own account, I don't welcome people to buy]
### Why Is RapidAPI required for this script?
- [TTEncrypt] - for device_registeration to generate your own devices [Soon documentations would be published] - endpoint is on API
- [Mssdk Enc/Dec] - for activating device_id, install_id, device_token by MSSDK for registration/login/follow [Soon documentations would be published] - endpoint is on API
- [TTSignature] - for every request in TikTok, it requires signatures (xa,xl,xh,xk) in headers to confirm you are not automating it, mainly checking on lc_id, params, stub hash, support MSSDK "v05.02.00-android" onwards [views/likes/shares all requires this]
### Why Some Parts Are Removed?
- We do not want to expose some bypass rate limit methods to the public as they would make our lives harder [ex. TikTok changing their anti-system once again]
- some of the functions are valuable and shouldn't be released
- some of the botting types required supreme accounts and not useful for releasing it
- some of them are for paid users
### Can I Rent a Private Server Instead Of RapidAPI?
- Of course you can, only if you need to use a lot of request
- We can support up to 8K requests per second
